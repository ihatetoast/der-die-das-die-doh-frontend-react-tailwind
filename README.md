# UI for Der Die Das Die Doh

## What (WiP)
A simple flashcard app where the user can pick and choose cards to work on or have them be random. As this is a work in progress, that's as committed as I'm getting, ya hear?

## Why?
  - My need for practicing German: I see many apps to practice German vocabulary with der, die, and das, but I don't see many that also add the plural. German has eight different ways of making plural and also some masculine nouns add an -en when not the nominative. 
  - My need to practice Tailwind. 
  - My need to just build out things as I think about what I want to do later. If I don't, I won't get any rest. This is just an idea for the frontend. It ain't the my first; won't me my last, darlin'. 
  - Your needs? Not my problem. Go get your own help.

## How
  - JS and CSS: React and Tailwind via Vite
  - Data: The data file is local until I know what I want and quit changing my mind as I go. The data is also for me at the moment. I will not add vocabulary I always know (man, woman, child) and stick with the ones that do my head in. Eventually an API, but until then, I'm playing with local data. 



This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
